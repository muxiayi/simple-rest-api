# simple-rest-api
Try to learn how to create REST API, so do a very simple task.

the method that using python and Flash to design RESTful APIs was learned from:
1. http://flask-restful-cn.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.5/quickstart.html 
2. https://www.ctolib.com/docs/sfile/head-first-flask/chapter03/section3.07.html#

1. The API provides GET, POST and DELETE function for restaurant, Menu, Menu Item.
2. The API is run in port 5000
3. The task can devide into two parts: first create a simple web app, code as :api web app;Second,create the API by using Flask library of Python, and I learned this from http://flask-restful-cn.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.5/quickstart.html.
